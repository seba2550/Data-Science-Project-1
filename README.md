# Data-Science-Project-1
This is a repository for the first project of the Data Science course (CCOM4995-033, Spring Semester), with all work performed by The Cases, a group of students made up by Coralys Cubero, Eddie Pérez, Sebastián Cruz, Alexa González, and Jean Rivera.  

Herein we recreate Dr. Rafael Irizarry's work estimating excess deaths in Puerto Rico after Hurricane María. Dr. Irizarry's original work (https://bit.ly/2HVuhhM) is performed using R, while we sought to perform the same analyses using Python.
